## Credits

This theme is mainly built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) ecosystem, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and some other wonderful tools (their copyright information can be found in the relevant files). The avatar and favicon design come from [Clipart Max](https://www.clipartmax.com/middle/m2i8b1m2K9Z5m2K9_ant-clipart-childrens-ant-cute/).

:tada: Thanks to all the volunteers who contributed to this project, their GitHub IDs are on [this list](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/graphs/contributors). Also, I won't forget those guys who submitted the issues or unmerged PR because they reported bugs, shared ideas, or inspired me to write more readable documentation.
