## Credits

This theme is mainly built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) ecosystem, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and some other wonderful tools (their copyright information can be found in the relevant files). The avatar and favicon design come from [Clipart Max](https://www.clipartmax.com/middle/m2i8b1m2K9Z5m2K9_ant-clipart-childrens-ant-cute/).
